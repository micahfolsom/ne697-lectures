# NE697 Lecture Code #

This repository contains the code from demonstrations during NE697 lectures,
which took place in the Fall of 2021 at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville
(via Zoom).

The course started with some C++ overview and assignments since students were
coming from a range of backgrounds. We proceeded to work through some Geant4
examples to get a feel for how to use the software. Then, we wrote our own
Geant4 code from scratch, starting with an empty directory.

The course finished with a few assignments based on our homegrown code, then
the final projects were determined by the students themselves.

Demo code associated with individual lectures is in its respective directory.

The Geant4 code we built in class, from scratch, is in another repository found
